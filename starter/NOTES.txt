--------------- NPM ----------------
npm : node package manager is a command line interface app that automatically comes 
included with node JS which use to manage and install open source packages
this packages they usually comes from the package REPO

What is a Package?
A package is a reusable piece of code (a library, tool, or framework) that solves a specific problem.

Examples:
express → build servers
lodash → utility functions
nodemon → auto-restart server


so the two types of packages that we can install are simple dependencies or devDependencies
❌ simple dependencies VS devDependencies
dependencies these are the packages your app needs in production
++ if u remove them your app will break ❌❌

📌 Examples:
express → to create the server
mongoose → to connect to database
react → to build the UI

2️⃣ DevDependencies (Development Dependencies)
packages use only while developing 
they helps to write codes, test or auto-restart the app
  and the app can run without them in production.
  📌 Examples:

nodemon → auto restart server
eslint → check errors
prettier → format code
jest → testing

✅ dependencies → app needs them to work
🛠 devDependencies → developer needs them to build the app

--------------------------slugify package (Dependencies) --------------------------
slugify is a simple node.js package that converts strings into URL-friendly

📌 A slug is:
✅ lowercase
✅ spaces replaced with -
✅ special characters removed

// Fresh Avocados From Morocco ===> fresh-avocados-from-morocco

--------------------------nodemon package (DevDependencies) --------------------------
is a development tool that automatically restart node js application whenever we saved the file

---------------------------
we have an global packages and local package
that means if u install a local it will work only on this project 
but if global it will work on each project on this device 
for Examples we can do it with nodemon and install it globally in every project on on this machine will access to it 
to do that ===> npm i -g nodemon (npm install global nodemon)
